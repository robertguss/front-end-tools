# ITCSS

is a way of organizing our SCSS in a way that is maintainable, especially as our styles begin to grow. It is a methodology/philosophy of how to organize styles by order of specificity.

## How we use ITCSS at IMT

```scss
// Variables only (no actual CSS output)
@import 'variables/*.scss';

// Tools â€“ Mixins and functions (no actual CSS output)
@import 'tools/*.scss';

// Components
// @import 'components/*.scss';
```
