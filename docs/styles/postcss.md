# PostCSS

[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) - is a tool that applies various transformations to CSS. PostCSS runs as the final step when transforming CSS.

> For example, SCSS our pre-processor will run first, and will output plain CSS. PostCSS will then execute over the plain CSS and provide the transformations desired via the installed plugins.

We are currently using the following plugins in this repo:

- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)

- [Rucksack](https://www.rucksackcss.org/)
